# What is PhilOpt?
With PhilOpt we wanted to contribute to making the world a better place. We wanted to create an optimal way of finding the right place to help others. The project was created during the hackathon event HackaTUM 2021. #
# How is it built?
We used React as a frontend JavaScript framework as well as Firebase for the backend and all the database entries.
